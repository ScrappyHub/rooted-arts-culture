# ROOTED Arts & Culture — Vertical Application

This repository powers the **Arts & Culture vertical** for ROOTED.

It sits on top of:

- `rooted-core` (providers, events, landmarks, discovery)
- `rooted-platform` (governance, trust & safety)

Arts & Culture is an **expression layer**, not an algorithmic ad platform.

## 🎭 What ROOTED Arts & Culture Is

Arts & Culture exists to:

- Surface **venues, galleries, theaters, and cultural centers**
- Show **events, exhibits, and performances**
- Tie cultural destinations into ROOTED’s **landmarks & seasonal intelligence**
- Respect community trust and safety rules

It is:

- ✅ Non-partisan
- ✅ Non-extractive
- ✅ Community-trust focused

It is NOT:

- ❌ A political campaign layer
- ❌ A demographic-targeted ad machine
- ❌ A social media engagement farm

---

## 🔒 Governance Boundaries

This repository:

- ❌ Does **NOT** define new political rules
- ❌ Does **NOT** introduce profiling or demographic targeting
- ❌ Does **NOT** change marketplace behavior
- ❌ Does **NOT** modify moderation law

It inherits:

- `ROOTED_PLATFORM_CONSTITUTION.md` (anti-profiling law)
- `ROOTED_COMMUNITY_TRUST_LAW.md`
- `MODERATION_SYSTEM.md` (all public events are moderated)
- `DISCOVERY_RULES.md` & `GEO_RULES.md` (locality and fairness)

---

## 🖼 Vertical Scope

Arts & Culture focuses on:

- Culture-focused **discovery pages** and filters
- Venue and institution **profile pages**
- Culture-linked **events calendars**
- Integration with **landmarks** for education and context
- Safe Kids experiences (e.g., youth-friendly arts content) without ticketing in Kids UI

---

## ✅ Allowed Work Here

- Design of culture-specific discovery components
- Venue profile layout & galleries
- Event calendar UI (using core events)
- Storytelling and context surfaces around arts & culture

## ❌ Forbidden Work Here

- Targeting or ordering by protected identity traits
- Ticketing flows that bypass billing & governance
- Political organizing or partisan promotion features
- New analytics that profile audience identity

---

## 🔗 Source of Authority

Arts & Culture is bounded by:

- Anti-profiling law
- Community trust law
- Moderation system
- Discovery + GEO rules

If a culture feature conflicts with those →  
**those laws win**.
