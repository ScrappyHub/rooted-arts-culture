# ROOTED Arts & Culture — Application Architecture

ROOTED Arts & Culture is a cultural discovery, education, and community enrichment vertical.

It does not function as a commerce engine.  
It is governed primarily by:

- ROOTED Platform Governance  
- ROOTED Core Data & Safety Law  
- Preservation, heritage, & expression rules  

This vertical is a *public enrichment layer*, not a marketplace.

## 🧠 Inherited Architecture Layers

Arts & Culture uses all standard ROOTED subsystems:

### Identity & Governance
- Auth + roles + tiers  
- Feature flags  
- Admin controls  
- Kids Mode overlays  
- Cultural sensitivity rules  

### Discovery & Intelligence
- Museums, galleries, theaters  
- Public art, history markers  
- Seasonal cultural calendars  
- Local heritage overlays  

### Safety & Consent Layer
- Cultural sensitivity filters  
- Kids Mode educational adaptation  
- No donation pressure in Kids Mode  
- No political or religious veiled messaging  

### Events & Experiences

## 🎭 Domain Philosophy

Arts & Culture is:

- **Human-first**
- **Non-commercial-first**
- **Community educational**
- **Free discovery for all**

It intentionally avoids:

❌ Hard monetization  
❌ Algorithmic ranking  
❌ Ads  
❌ Gatekeeping by tier  
❌ Political persuasion  
❌ Religious persuasion  

This vertical is the most trust-sensitive of the 21.

## 🧬 Vertical Plug-in Doctrine

Arts & Culture may define:

- Exhibit categories  
- Venue types  
- Cultural tags (heritage, tradition, celebration)  
- Nonprofit overlays  
- Kids educational adaptations  

But cannot:

- Modify governance  
- Introduce new commerce models  
- Affect procurement systems  
- Introduce political or religious content  

This vertical inherits ROOTED law everywhere.

## 🛑 Architectural Non-Negotiables

- Kids Mode must ALWAYS safe-filter cultural content  
- No event or exhibit may include unreviewed political messaging  
- No religious targeting unless parent-enabled AND culturally appropriate  
- Discovery rows follow the 6–8 rule  
- Cultural seasonality may not override holiday consent
